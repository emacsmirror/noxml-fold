#+Title: noXML-fold-mode

This is a minor mode that tries to enable useful folding for XML
files, copying a lot from AUCTeX's tex-fold.el. It builds on
nxml-mode, and will probably break horribly if it is not the
major-mode.

The most useful entry points are `noXML-fold-dwim', and
`noXML-fold-region'.

Since this mode uses overlays, it does *not* scale: for very long or
deeply nested XML structures, you should only fold what's within view
(`noXML-fold-visible'), or make use of `narrow-to-region'.
