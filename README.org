#+Title: noXML-fold-mode

This is a minor mode that tries to enable useful folding for XML
files, copying a lot from AUCTeX's tex-fold.el. It builds on
nxml-mode, and will probably break horribly if it is not the
major-mode.

** Quickstart

1) Get the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   git clone https://github.com/paddymcall/noXML-fold.git /some_path_you_like
   #+END_SRC
2) Edit your ~/.emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/some_path_you_like")
   (add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook (lambda () (require 'noxml-fold)))
   #+END_SRC
3) Then try to open an xml file, make sure you're in nxml-mode, and
   load noXML-fold with `M-x noXML-fold-mode'.

The most useful entry points are `noXML-fold-dwim', and
`noXML-fold-region'. For smaller files, you can also try
`noXML-fold-buffer'.

** Limitations

Since this mode uses overlays, it does *not* scale: for very long or
deeply nested XML structures, you should only fold what's within view
(`noXML-fold-visible'), or make use of `narrow-to-region'.
